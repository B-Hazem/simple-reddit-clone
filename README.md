Simple-reddit-clone is a simple and minimalistic reproduction of Reddit.com<br><br>

The frontend uses React, TailwindCSS and some components from shadcn.<br>
The backend uses Deno, expressjs, Turso (SQLite) with drizzle-orm and lucia-auth.<br><br>

The whole app is available [here](https://src.hazem-dev.xyz)<br>
I used Deno Deploy for the backend API and Cloudfare Pages for the frontend.
